Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using machine learning. The goal is to predict whether a movie review is Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the text provided. The model is built using Logistic Regression, trained on a dataset of movie reviews. The reviews are preprocessed by cleaning the text, removing special characters, and eliminating stopwords. The dataset is then vectorized using CountVectorizer to convert the text into numerical format, which is fed into the model for prediction.

The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and nltk for data processing and modeling. It enables real-time sentiment predictions where users can input a movie review, and the model will output the sentiment classification: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The model is evaluated based on its accuracy, which is around 65%, but there is potential for improvement with hyperparameter tuning, adding more data, or experimenting with other machine learning algorithms.

Installation
To get started with this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine along with pip for package management. The required dependencies for this project can be installed using pip. Clone the repository and install the necessary libraries from the requirements.txt file. Make sure to replace the path to the dataset with the correct one if needed.

Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can run the sentiment analysis script. After loading the dataset and preprocessing the reviews, the model is ready for predictions. At runtime, you can input a review, and the model will return the sentiment prediction. For example, a review like "The movie was fantastic! I loved it." would be predicted as "Positive."

Features
Text Preprocessing: The review text is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized.
Multiple Sentiment Classes: The model classifies reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Real-Time Predictions: The user can input reviews and receive real-time predictions for sentiment.
Model
The sentiment analysis model is based on Logistic Regression. It processes text data by:

Lowercasing all words
Removing special characters
Eliminating stopwords (using NLTK)
Vectorizing the text using CountVectorizer
The model is evaluated on its accuracy, and improvements can be made by experimenting with different preprocessing techniques, machine learning models, or hyperparameter tuning.

Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 65%, but there are several ways to improve this result:

Hyperparameter tuning
Using different models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Random Forest
Adding more data or refining the data preprocessing steps
