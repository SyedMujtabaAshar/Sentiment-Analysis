# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains a machine learning model built using Logistic Regression to classify movie reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The model is trained using a dataset of movie reviews, and the reviews are preprocessed (cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized) before being passed through the model for prediction.

The project uses Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and nltk for data preprocessing and modeling.
The dataset used consists of movie reviews along with their sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).
The final output is a Python function that allows users to input a review at runtime and get a sentiment prediction.

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, and that you have pip for package installation.

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
Install Required Libraries
Clone the repository and install the dependencies listed below:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the sentiment analysis model:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
Open the sentiment_analysis.py file.

Change the dataset path if necessary (line 18 in the script):

python
Copy code
url = "path_to_your_dataset/sentiment_analysis.csv"
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py
Input a movie review when prompted:

bash
Copy code
Enter your review: The movie was fantastic! I loved it.
Predicted Sentiment: Positive
Features
Preprocessing: The input review is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into a numerical format using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.
Multiple Sentiments: Predicts whether a review is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Real-time Predictions: Users can input reviews at runtime and get real-time sentiment predictions.
Model
The model is based on Logistic Regression and is trained on a dataset of labeled movie reviews.

Preprocessing includes:

Lowercasing the text
Removing special characters
Removing stopwords (using NLTK)
Feature Engineering uses CountVectorizer (or TF-IDF) to convert the cleaned text into numerical features.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy and can be further tuned using hyperparameters.

Results
Once the model is trained, it can classify reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments with an accuracy of around 65%.

Accuracy can be improved with:

Hyperparameter tuning.
Using different models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or Random Forest.
Adding more data or fine-tuning preprocessing steps.
